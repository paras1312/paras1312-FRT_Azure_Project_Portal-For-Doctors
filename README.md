# paras1312-FRT_Azure_Project_Portal-For-Doctors
https://staticwebsite1312.z5.web.core.windows.net     : The above link is of my website link that I deployed on Microsoft Azure portal using azure services. https://staticwebsite1312.z5.web.core.windows.net: is a link of detailed video description of my project that I deployed on Microsoft Azure portal and an telegram app.

During this period of Covid-19, to reduce the stress and burden of doctors of our medical sector & also to make people aware and give some information about symptoms of various diseases and their solutions to patients so that they can take precautionary actions on time, I made Azure ChatBot system which I eventually implement in my website or portal named as "Portal for Doctors". I have also implemented this ChatBot system in "Telegram" app to get a health ChatBot assistant in them. Portal for Doctors is my college mini-project on which I am working on. Basically, I made this project to help the doctors and patients in their busy schedule so that doctors can give the treatment and patients can get the treatement in lesser time with no waiting and any hustle. I implement this ChatBot in my portal / website to get this health ChatBot assistance for serving the patients anytime. This Health ChatBot Assistance can give the best advice to the patients that they can take on time.

So, when user will access the our site :https://staticwebsite1312.z5.web.core.windows.net,
